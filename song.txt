And I sing my songs of innocence
To you my precious child as you lay on your bed
With your sleepy eyes and your heavy head
Rest and dream in peace till morning comes again
I will sing my songs of innocence
I will sing my songs of innocence
Allaahu Allaahu
Laa ilaaha illaahu
Allaahu Allaahu
Laa ilaaha illaahu
